Project Title: Personal Portfolio
This website displays my portfolio with the following structure 
--> Home/Index page: this is the main landing page where a title showing that its a portfolio and a navigation button to the about me page is displayed. 

There's also arrows and a navigation bar on every page for an easier and faster page flips.

And a contact me mailto link for an easier contact navigation.
